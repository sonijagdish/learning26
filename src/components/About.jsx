        <p> Netflix is a global streaming service that lets people watch movies, TV shows, documentaries, and stand-up specials on demand through an internet connection, offering a mix of licensed content and a large catalog of Netflix Originals produced in-house or with partners around the world. Founded in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail company, it shifted to streaming in 2007 and went on to reshape how audiences consume entertainment, popularizing binge-watching and data-driven recommendations that personalize what viewers see. Today, Netflix operates in most countries, supports multiple devices, and continues to compete with other platforms by investing heavily in original series, films, international content, and new formats like games and live programming.</p>
